# Challenges Week 1

## Challenge One

* Create a class called ChallengeOne
* Declare three variables at the top of the class
  * An Integer, String, and Account. Do not assign them values to them yet.
* Declare two methods with the following signatures:
  * public void SetValues(){}
  * public void GetValues(){}
* In SetVaues assign values to the **Integer** and **String** variable and initialize the **Account** variable. Then assign the account.Name a value.
* In GetValues print to the debug log each of the variables.

## Challenge Two

* Create a class called ChallengeTwo.
* With the ChallengeTwo class create three methods with the following signatures:
  * public void ForLoop(){}
  * public void WhileLoop(){}
  * public void Iffy(){}
* In the ForLoop method create and initialize an **Integer List** that contains 1-10. Using a for each loop iterate through the list and print to the debug each value in the list.
* In the WhileLoop method declare an integer variable called **I** and assign it a value of 0. Using a while loop interate until **I** has a value of 10. 
* In the Iffy method check if a value is true, and if false check if another value is true. In both if blocks print to the debug log a string. The criteria should be such that the code skips the first if block, and prints the string from the second if block.

## Challenge Three

* Create a class called ChallengeThree.
* Declare an Account variable.
* Create two methods with the following signatures:
  * public void SetAccount(){}
  * public void GetAccount(){}
* SetAccount should initialize the account, and assign values to name, annualrevenue, and description.
* GetAccount should print the account to the debug log.
